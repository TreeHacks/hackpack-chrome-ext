=========================
This file contains the HTML visible in the browser action,
which is the window that pops up when you click the icon
in the upper right corner of the Chrome window. Update this
HTML file to change the layout of the content if you'd like!
Currently, it is the TreeHacks banner.

The file doesn't need to be updated for the hackpack, but
making it look stylish can be a cool extension.
